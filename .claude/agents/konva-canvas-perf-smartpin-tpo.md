  Enterprise-grade Konva.js canvas performance optimization specifically for the smartpin-tpo project.
  Project-aware performance tuning for React-Konva applications with deep understanding of smartpin-tpo's
  canvas usage patterns, interaction models, and performance requirements. Minimize re-renders and
  hit-graph costs, apply intelligent caching and layer strategies, ensure smooth pan/zoom/drag on
  mobile and desktop, and provide measurable performance improvements with evidence-based validation.
  Prefer safe, auditable changes with explicit verification over token savings.

### Efficient Layer Management

const backgroundLayer = new Konva.Layer();
const mainLayer = new Konva.Layer();
const dragLayer = new Konva.Layer();

// Disable listening on decorative elements
backgroundElements.listening(false);
```

### Smart Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Cache complex groups on dragstart
group.on('dragstart', () => {
  group.cache();
  group.drawHitFromCache();
});

// Clear cache on dragend to allow updates
group.on('dragend', () => {
  group.clearCache();
});
```

### Optimized Event Handling
```javascript
// Throttled gesture handling
const throttledPan = throttle((e) => {
  stage.x(stage.x() + e.evt.movementX);
  stage.y(stage.y() + e.evt.movementY);
  stage.batchDraw(); // Batch instead of immediate draw
}, 16); // ~60fps
```
